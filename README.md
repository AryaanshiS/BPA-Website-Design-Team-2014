It looks like you're working on a BPA website design project! I was the regional and Indiana state champion in 2014. We placed 3rd nationally too!
Now I'm a software engineer working with security and networking but I still know my way around web development.
If you'd like some help/mentorship, please feel free to reach out to me! Respond to this PR if you would like to exchange contact details!
